## **Project Idea: AI Personal Knowledge Assistant (AI-PKA)**

### **Goal**

Build a multi-agent AI system where the main agent acts as your **personal knowledge manager**. You give it a prompt like:

> “Write a blog post on quantum computing trends, including current research, historical context, and potential business applications.”

The **main agent dynamically decides** which sub-agents to call.

### **Agents and Tools**

1. **Research Agent**

   * Tools: Academic search API, News API, Wikipedia API.
   * Task: Gather the latest trends, papers, and articles.

2. **Summarizer Agent**

   * Tools: LLM summarization, text extraction functions.
   * Task: Summarize research outputs for easier consumption.

3. **Data/Statistics Agent**

   * Tools: Python scripts for graphs, APIs for datasets.
   * Task: Analyze trends, generate charts, calculate statistics.

4. **Writer Agent**

   * Tools: LLM, style guide functions, grammar checkers.
   * Task: Compose final content (blog post, report, email, etc.).

5. **Critic Agent**

   * Tools: LLM, style and fact-checking tools.
   * Task: Review content for errors, logical flow, and factual accuracy.

6. **Business/Strategy Agent**

   * Tools: Market trend APIs, business intelligence tools.
   * Task: Add business insights, ROI analysis, or market predictions.

### **Workflow (Dynamic)**

* User prompts the **Main Agent**.
* Main Agent **analyzes the request** and decides which sub-agents are required.
  * Example: If the prompt mentions “statistics,” it calls the Data Agent.
  * If “market impact,” it calls the Business Agent.
* Sub-agents **may call each other** if needed.
  * Example: Data Agent asks Summarizer Agent to condense raw dataset insights.
* Main Agent collects outputs from all sub-agents and produces a **cohesive final output**.
