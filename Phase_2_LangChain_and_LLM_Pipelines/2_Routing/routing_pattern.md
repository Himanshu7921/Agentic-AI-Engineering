# 🛣️ Why Do We Need Routing (vs. Prompt Chaining)?

### **1. Prompt Chaining = Linear Workflows**

* In chaining, the steps are **predefined and sequential**.
* Example:
  Text → Extract Specs → Convert to JSON.
* This works when the workflow is **always the same**.

👉 Problem: What if the workflow changes depending on the input?

---

### **2. The Limitation**

Imagine building an **intelligent agent** (like a support bot or assistant).

* Sometimes the user asks for *laptop specs extraction*.
* Sometimes they want *translation*.
* Sometimes they want *summarization*.

If we only use chaining:

* You’d have to force **all inputs through the same pipeline**, even when it doesn’t make sense.
* That’s **inefficient** and can give **wrong answers**.

---

### **3. Routing = Dynamic Decision-Making**

Routing introduces a **decision layer**:

* The system **analyzes the input or context**.
* Based on conditions, it **chooses the correct chain/tool/sub-agent**.

So instead of a single linear pipeline, you get a **branching workflow**.

---

### **4. Example Analogy**

Think of a **call center**:

* Prompt Chaining = You always talk to the same department in sequence (Reception → Tech → Billing), no matter your problem.
* Routing = The receptionist listens first, then **directs you to the right department** immediately (Billing, Tech, or General Info).

---

### **5. Concrete LangChain Example**

Suppose you’re building an **AI assistant for laptops**:

* If input asks **“What are the specs?”** → Route to *Specs Extraction Chain*.
* If input asks **“Compare two laptops”** → Route to *Comparison Chain*.
* If input asks **“Summarize this review”** → Route to *Summarization Chain*.

👉 Routing makes the agent **adaptive**, instead of blindly following one chain.

---

✅ **In short:**

* **Prompt Chaining** = Good for fixed, step-by-step tasks.
* **Routing** = Needed when tasks vary dynamically → The model must **choose the right path**.

---

### 🔀 Routing Methods

1. **LLM-based Routing**

   * The LLM itself decides the route by outputting a category/label.
   * Example: “Classify query as *Order Status*, *Product Info*, etc.”

2. **Embedding-based Routing**

   * Convert query → embedding vector.
   * Compare with predefined route embeddings → choose closest match.
   * Useful for **semantic meaning**, not just keywords.

3. **Rule-based Routing**

   * Uses fixed logic (if-else, regex, keyword match).
   * **Fast & deterministic**, but rigid and less adaptable.

4. **ML Model-based Routing**

   * A separate trained classifier decides the route.
   * More **specialized & accurate** (if good training data exists).
   * Unlike LLM-routing, the decision is in the **model’s learned weights**, not a prompt.

---

👉 **In short:**

* **LLM-based** = flexible, prompt-driven.
* **Embedding-based** = semantic similarity.
* **Rule-based** = fast, rigid logic.
* **ML-based** = trained classifier, specialized decision-maker.

---

# 🔀 Routing Implementation

* **Routing in Code** → Define multiple possible paths (sub-agents, tools, or chains) and the **logic** that decides which path to take.
* **LangChain** provides router chains (`MultiPromptChain`, `RouterChain`).
* **LangGraph** uses a **state-based graph structure**, making it intuitive to **visualize and implement routing** (nodes = agents/tools, edges = routing decisions).

---

### **Delegation Pattern**

* A **coordinator (router)** uses an **LLM** to classify the user’s intent.
* Based on the classification, the coordinator **delegates** the request to the appropriate **sub-agent/handler**.
* Example:

  * `Booking` → Booking handler
  * `Information` → Info handler
  * `Unclear` → Fallback handler

This pattern simulates how **multi-agent architectures** work:

* One **router agent** decides the task.
* Specialized **sub-agents** execute the task.

---

✅ **In short:** Routing = Adaptive decision-making in agent systems.
The **delegation pattern** = A router decides → sub-agents execute.
