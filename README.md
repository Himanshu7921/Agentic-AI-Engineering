# LangChain Engineering: Building Practical AI Agents

From pretrained models to RAG pipelines and advanced LLM applications, this repository provides a **hands-on roadmap to mastering LangChain engineering** and building real-world AI workflows. This guide is structured for both learning and practical implementation, helping you move from foundational concepts to advanced multi-agent systems.

**Built on top of:** [*A Hands-On Guide to Building Intelligent Systems* by Antonio Gulli](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rsaK53T3Lg5KoGwvf8ukOUvbELRtH-V0LnOIFDxBryE/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.pxcur8v2qagu)

## Project Organization

This project is organized into **4 main phases**, each containing detailed notes, code examples, and mini-projects:

```
├── Phase_0_LLM_Engineering_Basics
├── Phase_01_Fundamentals_and_Basic_Agents
├── Phase_02_Memory_Learning_and_Goals
├── Phase_03_Recovery_Human_Interaction_and_Knowledge
├── Phase_04_Advanced_Agent_Communication_and_Optimization
├── README.md
```

Each **phase folder** includes a dedicated README file that provides:

* An **Overview** describing the focus and scope of the phase.
* A list of **Chapters**, with brief explanations and practical relevance for each concept.
* **Outcome Skills** highlighting the practical abilities and knowledge you will gain after completing the phase and implementing the code.
* **Reference Document Placeholders** where you can attach relevant PDFs or documents for each chapter.
* A **Credits** section acknowledging the source material, *A Hands-On Guide to Building Intelligent Systems* by Antonio Gulli, along with a link to the reference document.

This structure ensures that each phase is **self-contained, easy to navigate**, and provides a clear roadmap for learning and applying advanced AI agent techniques.
