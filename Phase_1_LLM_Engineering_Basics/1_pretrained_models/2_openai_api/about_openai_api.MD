## 1. Why OpenAI’s GPT models aren’t on Hugging Face

- **Closed-source / proprietary** → OpenAI doesn’t release the actual weights of GPT-4, GPT-4o, or GPT-3.5.  
- **Too large** → even if they released them, GPT-4 is estimated to have trillions of parameters, requiring massive compute.  
- **Business model** → OpenAI provides access through API-as-a-service, not as downloadable weights.  

This lets them:
- Control costs  
- Prevent misuse  
- Continuously update models without redistributing files  

So, Hugging Face can’t host GPT-4 the way it hosts BERT.  
Instead, Hugging Face provides integrations to call OpenAI APIs via **transformers** or **datasets**, but not the models themselves.

## 2. When to use Hugging Face models

- You want full control over the model.  
- You need to fine-tune on custom data.  
- You want to run models locally or on your own servers (e.g., LLaMA2, Mistral).  
- You want free/open-source options.  

**Example:** Fine-tune BERT on a sentiment dataset.

## 3. When to use OpenAI models

- You want state-of-the-art results instantly, without worrying about hardware.  
- You don’t want to manage GPUs or large downloads.  
- You care about reasoning ability, conversation quality, or coding tasks (GPT-4 is far ahead of most open models in reasoning).  
- You’re okay with a paid API.  

**Example:** GPT-4 for tutoring, reasoning-heavy tasks, or production AI chatbots.
