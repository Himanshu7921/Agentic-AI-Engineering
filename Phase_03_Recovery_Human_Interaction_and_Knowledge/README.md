# Part 3 – Recovery, Human Interaction, and Knowledge

## Overview
This phase emphasizes robustness, human-in-the-loop integration, and knowledge retrieval. Agents are designed to handle exceptions, collaborate with humans, and access external knowledge efficiently. These are crucial for building reliable, interactive AI systems.

## Chapters
1. **Exception Handling and Recovery** (8 pages)  
   - Strategies for recovering from errors.
   - Ensures resilience and uninterrupted workflows.
   - **Reference Document:** [Chapter 12 – Exception Handling and Recovery](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1C07AuMur6-infwE0viCp4QtAy_wWI-uceFm6MaYHQGk/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.m2kk4kdjt6ir)

2. **Human-in-the-Loop** (9 pages)  
   - Integrating human feedback in decision-making.
   - Practical for oversight, validation, and iterative improvement.
   - **Reference Document:** [Chapter 13 – Human-in-the-Loop](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ImOZcw6yeb7a-uRBMNP1VdovYfyip4IdsAcLu9yue-0/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.qrzxm15r65m9)

3. **Knowledge Retrieval (RAG)** (17 pages)  
   - Retrieval-Augmented Generation for accessing structured knowledge.
   - Combines external data sources with generative models.
   - **Reference Document:** [Chapter 14 – Knowledge Retrieval (RAG)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v96Oobio6xDOqbK8ejsXjmOc4Dp2uoLMo5_gfJgi-NE/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.en4qa3livrwz)

## Key Takeaways
- Enhances reliability and usability of agents.

- Efficient access to external knowledge improves agent outputs.

## Outcome Skills
After completing this phase, you will be able to:  
- Implement robust error-handling mechanisms for agents.  
- Integrate human feedback to improve agent decisions.  
- Retrieve and integrate external knowledge sources using RAG.  
- Design agents capable of interactive and resilient workflows.  
- Improve agent reliability in real-world applications.

## Code
- All chapters contain final code implementations.
