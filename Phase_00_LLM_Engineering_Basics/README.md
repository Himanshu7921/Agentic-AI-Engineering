# Phase 0 â€“ LLM Engineering Basics

## Overview

This phase introduces the **foundational concepts of Large Language Models (LLMs)** and their practical usage. You will gain hands-on experience with **pretrained models, prompt engineering, and embeddings**, laying the groundwork for building more advanced LangChain-powered agents in later phases.

The goal is to provide you with **practical skills to load, interact with, and optimize LLMs** without diving into training models from scratch.

## Chapters

### 1. Pretrained Models

* Learn to **load and use pretrained models** from HuggingFace and OpenAI.
* Explore popular models like **GPT-3/4, LLaMA, Falcon, MPT, and Vicuna**.
* Hands-on exercises: **transformers pipelines** for text classification, sentiment analysis, and text generation.
* **Mini-projects** demonstrate real-world applications of pretrained LLMs.

### 2. Prompt Engineering

* Understand **prompting techniques** for zero-shot, few-shot, and chain-of-thought reasoning.
* Learn to create **prompt templates** and instruction-tuned prompts.
* Practical exercises will help you **craft effective prompts for various NLP tasks**.

## Outcome Skills

After completing this phase, you will be able to:

* Load and generate text with **pretrained models**.
* Apply **prompt engineering techniques** for better LLM responses.
* Understand the importance of **embeddings and vector representations** for downstream applications.
* Implement **basic NLP workflows** using HuggingFace Transformers and OpenAI APIs.
