# Part 1 – Fundamentals and Basic Agents

## Overview
This phase covers the foundational concepts of building AI agents and orchestrating their workflows. It focuses on essential techniques such as prompt chaining, routing, parallelization, reflection, tool usage, planning, and basic multi-agent systems. The goal is to establish a strong foundation for designing intelligent agents and understanding their core interactions.

## Chapters
1. **Prompt Chaining** (12 pages)  
   - Chaining multiple prompts to create coherent workflows.

2. **Routing** (13 pages)
   - Directing inputs to the appropriate agents or modules.
   - Ensures efficiency in multi-agent pipelines.
   - **Reference Document:** [Chapter 2 – Routing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ux_n8n3T4bYndOjs1DKW5ccpC802KISdy2IWnlvYbas/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.4z8lmx41zi0a)

3. **Parallelization** (15 pages)
   - Running multiple agent tasks concurrently.
   - Improves performance and scalability.

4. **Reflection** (13 pages)
   - Agents self-evaluate their outputs.
   - Enables error correction and quality improvement.
   - **Reference Document:** [Chapter 4 – Reflection](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HXXJOQIMWowtLw4WMiSR360caDAlZPtl5dPPgvq9IT4/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.a7nkedxjnyap)

5. **Tool Use** (20 pages)
   - Integrating external tools and APIs with agents.
   - Real-world relevance: Using Wikipedia, APIs, or custom tools.
   - **Reference Document:** [Chapter 5 – Tool Use](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bE4iMljhppqGY1p48gQWtZvk6MfRuJRCiba1yRykGNE/edit?tab=t.0)

6. **Planning** (13 pages)
   - Strategic decision-making and action sequencing.
   - Builds agent autonomy for complex tasks.
   - **Reference Document:** [Chapter 6 – Planning](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18vvNESEwHnVUREzIipuaDNCnNAREGqEfy9MQYC9wb4o/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.fw3q1h542fh0)

7. **Multi-Agent Systems** (17 pages)
   - Collaboration between specialized agents.
   - Introduces orchestrators and agent coordination.
