# Part 2 – Memory, Learning, and Goals

## Overview
This phase introduces the concepts that allow agents to learn, adapt, and remember past interactions. It focuses on memory management, reinforcement mechanisms, learning strategies, model context handling, and goal monitoring. These concepts are critical for building intelligent agents capable of long-term autonomy and adaptive behavior.

## Chapters
1. **Memory Management** (21 pages)  
   - How agents store and retrieve information.
   - Ensures continuity in multi-turn tasks.
   - **Reference Document:** [Chapter 8 – Memory Management](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1asVTObtzIye0I9ypAztaeeI_sr_Hx2TORE02uUuqH_c/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.v6u4ntwfeghw)

2. **Learning and Adaptation** (12 pages)  
   - Agents optimize actions over time using feedback.
   - Includes reinforcement and adaptive learning strategies.
   - **Reference Document:** [Chapter 9 – Learning and Adaptation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UHTEDCmSM1nwB-iyMoHuYzVcu_B_4KkJ2ITGGUKqo8s/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.bip7t1uao14b)

3. **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** (16 pages)  
   - Managing context across complex models.
   - Standardizes agent interaction with multiple LLMs.
   - **Reference Document:** [Chapter 10 – Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1e6XimYczKmhX9zpqEyxLFWPQgGuG0brp7Hic2sFl_qw/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.u78flclucfe5)

4. **Goal Setting and Monitoring** (12 pages)  
   - Defining objectives and tracking progress.
   - Enables dynamic task adjustment based on performance.
   - **Reference Document:** [Chapter 11 – Goal Setting and Monitoring](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10ndlCB39BWjyFRWKpcoKib4vuPD1ojD-x0-ynMaf5uw/edit?tab=t.0)

## Key Takeaways
- Agents can retain memory and learn from experience.
- Implementation of adaptive, context-aware behaviors.
- Practical understanding of goal-driven agent design.

## Outcome Skills
After completing this phase, you will be able to:  
- Implement memory storage and retrieval for agents.  
- Apply learning algorithms for adaptive behavior.  
- Maintain model context across multiple LLMs.  
- Set, track, and adjust goals for autonomous agent systems.  
- Build agents capable of improving performance over time.

## Code
- All chapters contain final code implementations.
